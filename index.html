    <h1>SQL Challenge</h1>
    <div>    
        <p> This 
            <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/movie-database-exercise/subqueries-exercises-on-movie-database.php">movie database</a> 
        </p> 
        <p>Getting the movie title and year of movies that feature an actor whose surname starts with a W, ordered alphabetically by movie title. 
            Can rephrase this to an actor whose name meets the search criteria. In this case, Iâ€™ve searched for actors whose last name begins with a W in order to get multiple results, but this would be most useful when searching for all of the movies one specific actor has starred in. For example WHERE act_fname LIKE('Ewan') AND act_lname LIKE('McGregor')
        </p>
        <p>WHERE act_fname = 'Ewan' AND act_lname = 'McGregor'</p>
        <p>or if you can't remember their full name</p>
        <p>WHERE act_fname LIKE('Ewan%') AND act_lname LIKE('McGreg%')</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Sub-Query Example</h3>
        <p>In this example I've used sub-queries because I only need to access one column from each of the additional tables to complete the query.</p>
<pre>
<code>
SELECT mov_title AS title, mov_year AS year
FROM movie
WHERE mov_id IN (
SELECT mov_id
FROM movie_cast
WHERE act_id IN (
SELECT act_id
FROM actor
WHERE act_lname LIKE('W%')))
ORDER BY title ASC;
</code>
</pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        table
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>b</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>b</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>b</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>b</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Join Example</h3>
        <p>If I want to display the actors first and last names in addition to this being part of the search criteria, then I need to use joins instead to access these additional columns.</p>
<pre>
<code>
SELECT movie.mov_title AS title, movie.mov_year AS year, actor.act_fname AS first_name, actor.act_lname AS last_name
FROM movie
INNER JOIN movie_cast
ON movie.mov_id = movie_cast.mov_id
INNER JOIN actor
ON actor.act_id = movie_cast.act_id
WHERE actor.act_lname LIKE('W%')
ORDER BY title ASC;
</code>
</pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        table
    </div>
