        <h1>SQL Challenge</h1>
        <div>       
            <p> The following queries were created using the
                <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/movie-database-exercise/subqueries-exercises-on-movie-database.php">W3 Resource Movie Database.</a> 
                They return the movie title and year of all movies that feature an actor/s whose name/s match the search, 
                ordered alphabetically by movie title. 
            </p>
            <p>This is the table structure:</p>
            <div class="img-cont">
                <img src="./movie-database.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                The information that we need for this query is stored in two tables: movie and actor. We need the movie title and year 
                from movies, and to be able to search the actor table for an actor’s name. These two tables are not linked in any way, 
                there is not a primary/foreign key relationship set up to connect these tables. Instead, we have to use a third table, movie_cast, to 
                link these tables. movie_cast includes the act_id, which links it to the actor table, as well as the mov_id, which links 
                it to the movie table.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                In the below examples, I’ve searched for actors whose last names begins with a W in order to return multiple results. 
                However, this query would be most useful when requesting a list of all of the movies one specific actor has starred in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, WHERE act_fname = 'Ewan' AND act_lname = 'McGregor'.

            <h2>Sub-Query Example</h2>
            <p>For this first example, I've used sub-queries because we only need to access one column from each of the additional tables to complete the query.</p>
            <h3>Query</h3>
<pre>
<code>
SELECT mov_title AS title, mov_year AS year
FROM movie
WHERE mov_id IN (
    SELECT mov_id
    FROM movie_cast
    WHERE act_id IN (
        SELECT act_id
        FROM actor
        WHERE act_lname LIKE('W%')))
ORDER BY title ASC;

            <h3>Output</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>title</th>
                    <th>year</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Aliens</td>
                    <td>1986</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Boogie Nights</td>
                    <td>1997</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Good Will Hunting</td>
                    <td>1997</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Titanic</td>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                The columns mov_title and mov_year in the movie table are set to be displayed in the output, renamed as title and year. 
                We then use sub-queries to first link through to the movie_cast table with the mov_id, and then through to the actor table 
                using the act_id. In this second sub-query, we can then run the search on the actor’s name. 
            </p>
            <p>
                LIKE will return all matches that include the search input in the brackets. Beginning with a W means that all 
                results returned must start with a w – there cannot be other characters preceding this. The % is a wildcard which tells 
                SQL that you are happy for any characters to be present at the point where it is used. This means that all names that begin 
                with a w will be returned, regardless of which characters follow the w. Alternatively, to match the search input exactly, 
                you would use = instead of LIKE. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we use ORDER BY to sort the results alphabetically by the movie titles. ASC sorts from A-Z and technically 
                doesn’t need to be included in the above query, because it is the default setting. If we wanted to use DESC, Z-A, 
                then this would need to be specified.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Join Example</h2>
            <p>If I want to display additonal data from the actors table, such as the actors first and last names, 
                then joins are needed to access these additional columns.
            </p>
            <h3>Query</h3>
<pre>
<code>
SELECT DISTINCT movie.mov_title AS title, 
    movie.mov_year AS year, 
    actor.act_fname AS first_name, 
    actor.act_lname AS last_name

ON movie.mov_id = movie_cast.mov_id

        <div>
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                As in the previous query, we display the mov_title and mov_year columns from the movie table, renamed as title and year. 
                Additionally, we also want to display the actor/s’ first and last names from the actor table. These columns have also 
                been renamed to be clearer; act_fname becomes first_name and act_lname becomes last_name. The keyword DISTINCT is important, 
                because it ensures that each row is unique and that duplicate results are not returned. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We use INNER JOIN to first connect to the movie_cast table using the mov_id, and then again to connect to the actor 
                table using the act_id. Once the tables are connected, we can use the same WHERE clause as before, and sort the results 
                alphabetically by title with ORDER BY.
